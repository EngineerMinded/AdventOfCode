# AdventOfCode
Welcome to my Advent of Coded 2022 repositiory. This year, as much of it that I can do is written in C#. Advent of Code is challenging and will test your 
limits of Data structures and Analysis and algorithms. You may review this code. If you can learn something from it, cool. 

Thank you for your visit!!!!
