This was the advent of code from 2020 and,
I'm just doing some of it to keep me busy
until Dec 1, 2022 when the new one is released

Unlike the 2021 version, I start using objects
and classes in this one. This is just a self
exploratory thing to get used to python. If you
can learn from it, cool beans. Enjoy and God Bless
